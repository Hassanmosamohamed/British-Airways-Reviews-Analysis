Data Analysis & Key Findings
1. How have customer ratings changed over time?
The graph shows that customer ratings have fluctuated significantly between 2016 and 2023. There were periods of decline and improvement, suggesting that reviews might be influenced by factors such as economic crises, changes in company policies, or variations in service quality.

2. How do ratings vary by aircraft type?
The analysis reveals that the Boeing 747-400 received the highest average rating (4.7), while A321 and 777-200 had the lowest ratings (3.6). This could indicate differences in seat comfort, service quality, or noise levels across aircraft.

3. How does seat type affect ratings?
Ratings vary across different travel classes:

First Class and Business Class receive the highest ratings compared to Premium Economy and Economy.
Economy Class has the lowest ratings due to limited space and lower service quality.
4. Which continents give the best and worst ratings?
The distribution of ratings by region reveals significant differences:

Passengers from Europe and North America tend to give moderate to high ratings.
Passengers from Asia and Africa gave lower ratings, possibly due to different expectations or service quality variations on certain routes.
5. Is there a relationship between traveler type and ratings?
Ratings also vary based on the purpose of travel:

Business travelers tend to give lower ratings compared to tourists.
Family travelers often have higher expectations for service, which can affect their ratings.
